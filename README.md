# Data-Analysis---Stacked-Bar-Chart-with-Grouping-Variable

## Project Overview
This project involves constructing a stacked bar chart to analyze the preferred types of assessment among students, segmented by their athletic status. The analysis helps understand assessment preferences across different groups, highlighting unique trends and insights.

## Objectives
- To visualize the distribution of assessment preferences among students.
- To compare these preferences across different athletic statuses.
- To identify which assessment type is most favored by students with different athletic experiences.

## Methods Used
- Data visualization using R and ggplot2.
- Statistical analysis to compute proportions and understand trends.

## Results
- "No" athlete status group showed the lowest preference for course projects.
- Students who competed only in high school favored 'Course Projects' the most.
- 44.2% of students overall prefer course projects.

## Conclusions
This analysis provides valuable insights into how athletic participation can influence academic preferences, specifically in the type of assessments students prefer.

## How to Run the Project
- Required software: R and RStudio.
- Required libraries: ggplot2.

## File Descriptions
- `stacked_bar_chart_analysis.R`: This file contains all the R code used for generating the visualizations and calculations.
- `dataset.csv`: Data file used for the analysis (if public, otherwise describe the data structure required to replicate the analysis).
